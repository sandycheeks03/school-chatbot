# What it does:
- Lists all packages needed to run your code
- Lets others install dependencies easily

# Without requirements.txt: 
- Others have to guess what packages to install
- Might get version conflicts

# With requirements.txt: 
- One command to install everything: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensures everyone uses same versions
